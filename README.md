# pEeR RevIeW
Inspired by Deep Autofill Chrome Extension by Stephan Ahlf - his code can be found at https://github.com/s-a/deep-autofill-chrome-extension.

Note that pEeR RevIeW also autofills the text fields in the peer review form, but to protect anonymity I am not showing the actual outputs. Try it out yourself!

If you want to add more possible responses, head to run.js and edit the fakerResponsesAppreciate, fakerResponsesHate and fakerResponsesGroup arrays to your heart's content.

#### Disclaimer
This tool was made in jest, and is not meant to be used for actual submissions.
